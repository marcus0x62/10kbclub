This repo contains the source code for [The 10kb Club](https://10kb.club), an index of very
small (10KiB or less compressed size) websites.  For slightly larger sites, I also run
[The 100kb Club](https://100kb.club).

Why? The modern web is [too](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm)
[damn](https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/ten-years-page-bloat/)
[big](https://mobiforge.com/research-analysis/the-web-is-doom).

It doesn't have to be this way.  You can build an accessible, useful, functional, and,
depending on your tastes, beautiful, site without a mountain of JavaScript frameworks,
ad-tech BS, and malware (but I repeat myself.)

If you're into this sort of thing, also check out these (unaffiliated) sites:
* [The 250kb Club](https://250kb.club/)
* [512KB Club](https://512kb.club/)
* [1MB Club](https://1mb.club/)
